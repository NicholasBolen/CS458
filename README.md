EDIT: Sorry, forgot to commit and push this README. Basic project information here.

This is a compilation of the work done throughout all assignments and tutorials from this course.

My Major Project submission is held under the scene `level4`. To test, should be able to add the entire MajorProject folder to Unity, open the `level4` scene, and run the project.

Other levels may be semi-functional, but this was not verified at the time of this final submission and they are not to be included
